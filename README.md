# Home Automation System

## ABSTRACT

In the modern world, it is vital to control appliances in order to minimise human effort, make the best use of available technology, and carry out all tasks in an intelligent and effective manner. Energy must be conserved in every way possible, both outside and inside the immediate environment, because as the population grows, so does energy consumption. 

The idea that only one device may operate a variety of home equipment, such as turning on and off loads or appliances, is discussed in this paper. To create a straightforward, low-cost room automation system, multiple appliances are controlled by a single remote control ESP8266.In the proposed scheme, a circuit has been created that satisfies the specifications for operating the room's appliances with a portable remote control that can be used in any location in the room.

Extending this technique to automate a large-scale environment, like offices and factories, would be the next stage. Home Automation provides a universal benchmark for interconnected goods. Standardization makes smart houses possible that has controls for energy, environment, lighting, and appliances   management, security, and the capacity to expand connect to more networks.
